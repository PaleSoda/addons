att.Description = [[Scout troopers, also known as biker scouts, were a specialized stormtrooper variant used by the Galactic Empire on a range of missions, which mostly involved reconnaissance. In particular, scout troopers often used the 74-Z speeder bike. They had lighter armor than standard troopers, much like their urban counterparts, patrol troopers, who used C-PH patrol speeder bikes to navigate dense urban environments.]]
